# Emulator for Ben Eater's 6502 Project

I wanted to build this computer, but it is simply not feasable for me to purchase one right now.

So I went for the next best thing. Write my own emulator for it.

Currently, the CPU has very few instructions that it can actually handle, and it only does the bare minimum for the tutorial to work at the point that I'm at in following it.

I am currently at the point where we are bit-banging a Hello world message to the screen.

Right now, that will cause a println to be written to the console.
